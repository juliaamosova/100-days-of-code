# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 Hackerrank challenges (JavaScript).

**Thoughts:** Both challenges were related to operations with arrays. The 2nd one was not as easy as it seems to be.  

**Link to work:** 
1. [Print each array element in the reverse order](https://learningtocodediary.wordpress.com/2017/09/25/hackerrank-print-each-array-element-in-reverse-order/)
2. [Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in array](https://learningtocodediary.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/hackerrank-calculate-the-hourglass-sum-for-every-hourglass-in-array/)
